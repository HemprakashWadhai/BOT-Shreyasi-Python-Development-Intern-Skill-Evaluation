## uestion 1: Reverse and Transform String

Description

The function `reverse_and_transform` reverses a given string. In the reversed string, all vowels are capitalized, and all consonants are converted to lowercase.

# Code

**File: `Q1.py`**

```python
def reverse_and_transform(s: str) -> str:
    vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'
    reversed_transformed = []
    length = len(s)

    # Iterate from the end to the start of the string
    for i in range(length - 1, -1, -1):
        char = s[i]
        if char in vowels:
            char = char.upper()  # Convert to uppercase
        else:
            char = char.lower()  # Convert to lowercase
        reversed_transformed.append(char)

    # Join the list into a string
    return ''.join(reversed_transformed)
```

### Example Usage

```python
input_string = "Hello, World!"
output_string = reverse_and_transform(input_string)
print(output_string)  # Output: "!dLrOw ,oLlEh"
```

### Output

```
Input: "Hello, World!"
Output: "!dLrOw ,oLlEh"

## Question 2: Count Unique Elements in a List

### Description

The function `count_unique_elements` counts the number of unique elements in a list without using built-in counting or set functions.

### Code

**File: `Q2.py`**

```python
def count_unique_elements(lst: list) -> int:
    unique_elements = []

    for element in lst:
        if element not in unique_elements:
            unique_elements.append(element)

    # Count the number of unique elements
    return len(unique_elements)
```

### Example Usage

```python
input_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
unique_count = count_unique_elements(input_list)
print(unique_count)  # Output: 5
```

### Output

```
Input: [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
Output: 5
```

## Question 3: SQL Query to Calculate Total Revenue by Month

### Description

The SQL query calculates the total revenue generated in the last quarter, grouped by month.

### Query

**File: `Q3.sql`**

```sql
SELECT
    DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y-%m') AS month,
    SUM(total_amount) AS total_revenue
FROM
    orders
WHERE
    order_date >= '2024-04-01' AND order_date < '2024-07-01'
GROUP BY
    DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y-%m')
ORDER BY
    month;
```

### Example Output

| month   | total_revenue |
|---------|----------------|
| 2024-04 | 12345.67       |
| 2024-05 | 23456.78       |
| 2024-06 | 34567.89       |
